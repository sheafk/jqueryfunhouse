* Challenges: What was one thing you struggled with? How did you solve it?
* Technology Used: List 3 key parts of the code. 

##2) Linking to Multiple Pages

###Create a new page
* In Cloud9, create a new HTML file in the jqueryfunhouse project called `morefun.html`. 
* Give it a title and in the body write "FUN!".

*HINT: Use the HTML template.*

###Link to the new page
