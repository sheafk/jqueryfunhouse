#jQuery Funhouse Bonus Challenges

##Fill out the Readme

In Cloud 9, go to the file called `README.md.` Use the following questions as a guide to write your first Readme.

* Overview: Write one or two sentences that could explain to a complete stranger what you coded in this project. What does this website do?
* Challenges: What was one thing you struggled with? How did you solve it?
* Technology Used: List 3 key parts of the code. 

##Linking to Multiple Pages

In Cloud9, create a new HTML file in the jqueryfunhouse project called `morefun.html`. Give it a title and in the body write "FUN!".

*HINT: Use the HTML template.*

Next, link to that page from `index.html` with text that says "Click here for more fun". When you click on "Click here for more fun", it should go to your second HTML page.
