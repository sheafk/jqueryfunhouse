#jQuery Funhouse Bonus Challenges

Here are 3 bonus challenges for students who have completed the jQuery Funhouse.

##1) Fill out the Readme

In Cloud 9, go to the file called `README.md.` Use the following questions as a guide to write your first Readme.

* Overview: Write one or two sentences that could explain to a complete stranger what you coded in this project. What does this website do?
* Challenges: What was one thing you struggled with? How did you solve it?
* Technology Used: List 3 key parts of the code. 

##2) Link to a Second Page

####Create a new page
* In Cloud9, create a new HTML file in the jqueryfunhouse project called `morefun.html`. 
* Give it a title and in the body write "MORE FUN!".

*HINT: Use the HTML template.*

####Link to the new page
* Next, go to `index.html`and add a link to your new page with text that says "Click here for more fun".

When you click on "Click here for more fun", it should go to your second HTML page.

##3) Help a friend
